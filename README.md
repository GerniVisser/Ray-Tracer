# Ray Tracing  - Golang 
Hi! here is my first implementation of a simple Ray Tracer in Go. This implementation is heavily inspired by the excellent book by Jamis Buck, [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge). It is a complete explanation of how a Ray Tracer work and can be implemented in any language of your choice.

# Development 
I wanted to learn a low level language for a while and decided this project would be the perfect oppertunity. I first thought of using C++ when I discovered [Go](https://go.dev/) a low level language developed by Google with just 27 keywords.
